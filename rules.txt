RULES OF THE HUNGER
-------------------
1. You are the ampersand: &. It is like a caveman or something. It is hungry

2. You must move via the arrow keys toward your goal, the "2"

3. You have a limited amount of moves, or "food", to get to the food. Run out of food and you
"starve" aka lose.

4. The goal moves everytime you move. You must outsmart the goal. You can see
the path that the goal will take, it is shown via the "+"s that lead the "2"
(if there is no path for the "2", it will stop moving)

5. You cannot move through "X"s. Those are cave walls or trees or something.
Caveman theme. 

6. You must move; there is no way to be stationary and let the "2" move. (You
can just move back and forth, which does the same thing.)
